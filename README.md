## üìå Problem Statement
Bharat Herald, a 70-year-old legacy newspaper, is facing an existential crisis in the **post-COVID digital era**.  
Between **2019‚Äì2024**, print circulation dropped from 1.2M to under 560K.  
While competitors embraced **mobile-first, WhatsApp delivery, and subscription bundles**, Bharat Herald‚Äôs digital pilot failed.  

This project analyzes **operational and financial data (2019‚Äì2024)** to:  
- Quantify what went wrong  
- Identify recovery opportunities  
- Recommend a phased roadmap for digital transformation
